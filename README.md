## Greedy Cost Calculation (Python)

### Problem
Given free units `K` and `N` items, each with time `Ti` and cost `Di`,
use free units optimally to minimize total cost.

### Approach
- Use free units first (greedy)
- Pay only for remaining units
- Time Complexity: O(N)

### Example Input
1 
3 5
4 10
3 5
2 20

### Output
50
